# Streamlit-App-to-Update-CSV-dataframes
A simple App using Streamlit and Python to update a local Excel file. 
Streamlit must be installed.
I used Anaconda to create an environment called StLit, and from StLit's terminal run 'pip install streamlit'
Here is the official installation guide: https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation

The CSV file you'll be updating must in the same Path where the streamlit environment was created. 
Open the environment and Run whatever Python IDE you use to write the python code
Open the streamlit environment terminal and run the command 'streamlit run [your code.py]'
Streamlit should open on your browser
